title: About
---


I am Sven Schmit, a sixth year PhD Student at [Stanford](http://icme.stanford.edu) working with [Ramesh Johari](http://www.stanford.edu/~rjohari).
My interests are at the interface of statistics, mathematics and computer science and I aspire to bring theory and practice together.

Currently, my research focuses on how human interaction with learning systems affects outcomes and
how we can design such systems to take advantage of this.

## Internships


- **Stitch Fix**, Summer 2014 and Summer 2015

    [Stitch Fix](http://www.stitchfix.com) is reinventing the retail industry through innovative technology.
    During my two summers at Stitch Fix, I worked on improving the recommendation engine that is used by stylists,
    along with tinkering on some side projects.
    Furthermore, I wrote a [blog post](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/10/15/multiple-hypothesis-testing/) for the tech blog on multiple testing.


- **HP Labs**, Summer 2013

    [HP Labs](http://www.labs.hpe.com/) is the research division of Hewlett-Packard.
    I worked under supervision of Rob Schreiber and with fellow intern Austin Benson on fault tolerance for the next generation of super computers.
    We demonstrated that we can make numerical methods resilient to silent errors at negligible cost by using mathematical properties of the methods.
    This has led to the publication of [Silent error detection in numerical time-stepping syhemes](http://hpc.sagepub.com/content/29/4/403).


## Teaching


- **CME 193** Introduction to Scientific Python

    Instructor for a one-unit introductory course on Python multiple times.
    We cover the basics of Python, and dive deeper into the mathematically oriented libraries,
    such as Numpyy Scipy and Matplotlib.
    We also cover modern tools, such as the Jupyter Notebooks.

    Material of the course is available on the [course website](http://www.stanford.edu/~schmit/cme193)
    and [github](https://github.com/schmit/intro-python-course).


- **MS&E 226** Small data

    Teaching assistant for the excellent course on ["small" data](http://web.stanford.edu/class/msande226/) taught by Ramesh Johari.


- **CME 106** Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers

    Teaching assistant for a first course in probability and statistics for engineering students at Stanford.

    A review of the probability theory taught in the class can be found [here](http://stanford.edu/~schmit/misc/cme106_review.pdf).

## Side projects

- I submitted a [bot](https://github.com/schmit/halite-bot) to the [Halite](http://2016.halite.io) artificial intelligence competition which finished in the top 3%.

- [Here](https://github.com/schmit/fun-notebooks) is a collection of some Jupyter notebooks for fun little projects.
    For example, there is a [notebook](https://github.com/schmit/fun-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/march-madness-2017/how-i-fill-my-bracket-2017.ipynb)
   to help me fill out my March Madness bracket by modeling basketball outcomes using Stan.
