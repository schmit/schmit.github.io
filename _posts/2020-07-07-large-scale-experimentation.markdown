[Ramesh Johari](http://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/), [Virag Shah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/virag-shah-bb986419/), and myself wrote an academic paper on "large scale experimentation" that introduces a framework on how to think about optimal testing when there are a lot of possible experiments to run.

To accompany the more technical academic paper, I wrote [a blog post with a more intuitive exposition of the main ideas for the Multithreaded blog](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2020/07/07/large-scale-experimentation/).

My personal aspect of this blog post is the interactive visualization by [Brian Coffey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianedwardcoffey/) where the reader is encouraged to explore different testing strategies.
