*Hi, I am Sven Schmit and I am a fourth year PhD student at Stanford.*

My interests are at the interface of statistics, mathematics and computer science and I aspire to bring theory and practice together. 

I feel incredibly fortunate to work with [Prof. Johari](http://www.stanford.edu/~rjohari).

## Education

- **PhD Computational and Mathematical Engineering**

    Stanford University (expected: 2017)

- **MASt Mathematics** *with merit*
    
    University of Cambridge (2012)

- **BSc Econometrics and Operations Research** *summa cum laude*
    
    University of Groningen (2011)

## Internships

- **Stitch Fix**
    
    [Stitch Fix](http://www.stitchfix.com) is reinventing the retail industry through innovative technology.
    During my two summers there, I worked on improving the recommendation engine that is used by stylists,
    along with tinkering on some side projects.
    Furthermore, I wrote a [blog post](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/10/15/multiple-hypothesis-testing/) for the tech blog on multiple testing.


    *Summer 2014, Summer 2015*

- **HP Labs**

    HP Labs is the reseach division of Hewlett-Packard.
    I worked under supervision of Rob Schreiber and with fellow intern Austin Benson on fault tolerance for the next generation of super computers.
    We demonstrated that we can make numerical methods resilient to silent errors at negligible cost by using mathematical properties of the methods. 
    This has led to the publication of [Silent error detection in numerical time-stepping schemes](http://hpc.sagepub.com/content/29/4/403).
