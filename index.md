title: About
---

This is the personal web page of Sven Schmit, a fourth year PhD Student at [Stanford](http://icme.stanford.edu).
My interests are at the interface of statistics, mathematics and computer science and I aspire to bring theory and practice together. 

I feel incredibly fortunate to work with [Prof. Johari](http://www.stanford.edu/~rjohari), 
and to be a member of the [Social Algorithms Lab](http://web.stanford.edu/group/soal/).

## Education

- **PhD Computational and Mathematical Engineering**, expected 2017

    Stanford University 

- **MASt Mathematics** *with merit*, 2012
    
    University of Cambridge 

- **BSc Econometrics and Operations Research** *summa cum laude*, 2011
    
    University of Groningen

## Internships

- **Stitch Fix**, Summer 2014 and Summer 2015
    
    [Stitch Fix](http://www.stitchfix.com) is reinventing the retail industry through innovative technology.
    During my two summers at this amazing company, I worked on improving the recommendation engine that is used by stylists,
    along with tinkering on some side projects.
    Furthermore, I wrote a [blog post](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/10/15/multiple-hypothesis-testing/) for the tech blog on multiple testing.


- **HP Labs**, Summer 2013

    [HP Labs](http://www.labs.hpe.com/) is the reseach division of Hewlett-Packard.
    I worked under supervision of Rob Schreiber and with fellow intern Austin Benson on fault tolerance for the next generation of super computers.
    We demonstrated that we can make numerical methods resilient to silent errors at negligible cost by using mathematical properties of the methods. 
    This has led to the publication of [Silent error detection in numerical time-stepping schemes](http://hpc.sagepub.com/content/29/4/403).


## Papers

- [Learning Multifractal Structure in Large Networks](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2623718), KDD14
    
   *with [Austin Benson](http://www.stanford.edu/~arbenson) and [Carlos Riquelme](http://rikel.me).*

- [Silent error detection in numerical time-stepping schemes](http://hpc.sagepub.com/content/29/4/403), IJHPC

    *with [Austin Benson](http://www.stanford.edu/~arbenson) and [Rob Schreiber](http://www.labs.hpe.com/people/rob_schreiber/).*

## Teaching

- **CME 193** Introduction to Scientific Python

    Taught a one-unit introductory course on Python multiple times. 
    We cover the basics of Python, and dive deeper into the mathematically oriented libraries,
    such as Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.
    We also cover modern tools, such as the Jupyter Notebooks.

    Material of the course is available on the [course website](http://www.stanford.edu/~schmit/cme193) 
    and [github](https://github.com/schmit/intro-python-course).


- **MS&E 226** Small data

    Teaching assistent for the excellent course on ["small" data](http://web.stanford.edu/class/msande226/) taught by Prof. Johari.


- **CME 106** Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers

    Teaching assistent for a first course in probability and statistics for engineering students at Stanford.

    A review of the probability theory taught in the class can be found [here](http://stanford.edu/~schmit/misc/cme106_review.pdf).
